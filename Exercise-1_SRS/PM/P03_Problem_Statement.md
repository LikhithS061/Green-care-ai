## Problem Statement

Novice gardeners often struggle with choosing the right plants for their specific
environment. They fail because they select plants ill-suited to their soil type,
climate conditions, and available resources. Additionally, they cannot identify
plant diseases in time, leading to high plant mortality rates.

Traditional gardening apps provide generic advice that doesn't account for local
soil composition (NPK levels, pH) or real-time environmental factors. This creates
frustration for home gardeners and hobbyists who invest time and money only to
see their plants fail.

As a result, many potential gardeners give up, and urban farming initiatives face
unnecessary setbacks. This creates inefficiencies in home gardening and reduces
the adoption of sustainable practices.

To address these challenges, the project proposes 'Greencare AI' - an intelligent
plant recommendation and gardening assistant that leverages Transformer-based AI
for personalized plant suggestions and YOLOv8 for real-time disease diagnosis,
helping users make informed decisions based on their specific environmental conditions.
