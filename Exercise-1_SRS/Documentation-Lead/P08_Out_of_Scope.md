## Scope Definition – Out-of-Scope Features

The following features are **explicitly excluded** from the current project scope:

### 1. E-commerce Integration

- Payment gateway integration
- Order management and shipping

**Reason:** Focus on advisory functionality; commercial features can be Phase 2.

### 2. IoT Hardware Integration

- Temperature/humidity sensors
- Automated watering systems

**Reason:** Hardware dependencies add complexity; manual input sufficient for MVP.

### 3. Commercial Crop Management

- Large-scale farming recommendations
- Crop rotation planning
- Agricultural yield optimization

**Reason:** Target audience is home gardeners, not commercial farmers.

### 4. Native Mobile Applications

- iOS native app
- Android native app

**Reason:** PWA provides sufficient mobile experience; native apps are future scope.

### 5. Social Features

- User forums or community
- Plant sharing/trading
- Social media integration

**Reason:** Core focus is on AI recommendations, not social networking.

### 6. Offline Mode

- Offline AI inference
- Local data storage
- Sync when online

**Reason:** AI models require cloud processing; offline mode adds complexity.
